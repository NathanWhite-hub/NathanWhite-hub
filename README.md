This is my Github repository for all of my programming projects. I’ve been programming since grade school and have experience with Java, C#, Objective-C, SQL, and most recently Python. I learn every day, I’m detail oriented, and I’m a problem solver that puts all of my energy into my work. I am currently working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of Dec 2021.
