This is my Github repository for all of my programming projects. I’ve been programming since grade school and have experience with Java, C#, Objective-C, SQL, and most recently Python. I learn every day, I’m detail oriented, and I’m a problem solver that puts all of my energy into my work. For the past three years I’ve worked in law enforcement and am currently working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of Dec 2021.
